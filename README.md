self-hosted is a my personal maintained infrastructure as files of my self-hosted server.

## TODO
- [ ] Fix whoami service or swap for ping service
- [ ] Configure Nextcloud
- [ ] Build custom vscode container for [settings sync](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/issues/148)
- [ ] Fix traefik [dashboard](https://docs.traefik.io/v2.2/operations/dashboard/#dashboard-router-rule)
- [ ] Migrate from docker-compose to docker stack or kubernetes (local e.g. minikube) and [helm](https://helm.sh/) due to managing cpu and memory limits
